# Blog

This is my personal blog's template. You can use it as your blog if you'd love to. If you like it, please leave a star.

Before using, you need to set the counter.js, it requires CA to get https connection. If you don't have CA, delete the codes about it.

Be sure the ports needed are open otherwise the requests will be blocked by the firewall.

I provide a .bat file here for windows server. The server need a NodeJS env installed, together with some packages. Check them before run.
